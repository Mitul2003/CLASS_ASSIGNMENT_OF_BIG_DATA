He also still needs to work\n","on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\n","was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\n","be a major key to the offense next year.\n","\n","#15\tDAVID BRUCE\t\tSeason: 5th\n","Acquired:\t'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\n","Grade:\t\tI (?)\n","\n","After a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\n","was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\n","virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\n","lineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\n","speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\n","the injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\n","short in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\n","leader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\n","because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\n","future with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\n","\n","#18\tMARK PEDERSON\t\tSeason:\t3rd\n","Acquired:\t'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud\n","Grade:\t\tI (B)\n","\n","It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,\n","after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\n","after riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\n","Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\n","41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\n","injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\n","healthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\n","(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a\n","physical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\n","on defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\n","much, exactly, Pederson can do.\n","\n","#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th\n","Acquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Boston\n","Grade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n","\n","Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\n","work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\n","did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\n","games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\n","do, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\n","20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\n","hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\n","zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\n","but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\n","offensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\n","is very unlikely to be back next season.\n","\n","#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\n","Acquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\n","Grade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n","\n","I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n","14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\n","opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\n","duty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\n","14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\n","camp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in\n","exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\n","Sharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\n","solid contender for regular duty next season.\n","\n","#41\tMARK BEAUFAIT\t\tSeason: 1st\n","Acquired:\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\n","Grade:\t\tI (?)\n","\n","After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\n","Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\n","Sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\n","NHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\n","to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\n","although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\n","mostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\n","Kansas City.\n","\n","#42\tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\tSeason: 1st\n","Acquired:\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\n","Grade:\t\tI (?)\n","\n","Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\n","up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\n","very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\n","although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\n","7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\n","defense is acceptable, he should be ready.\n","\n","#44\tMICHEL PICARD\t\tSeason: 1st\n","Acquired:\t'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\n","Grade:\t\tI (B-/C+)\n","\n","The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\n","be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\n","Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\n","his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\n","He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\n","brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\n","he has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the\n","expansion draft.\n","\n","#45\tDODY WOOD\t\tSeason: 1st\n","Acquired:\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\n","Grade:\t\tI (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)\n","\n","I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\n","no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\n","13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\n","not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\n","many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\n","projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at\n","least another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\n","nothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\", 181 lbs.) does not give much\n","possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\n","************************************************** ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ --------------------------------------------------\n"]}]}]}
